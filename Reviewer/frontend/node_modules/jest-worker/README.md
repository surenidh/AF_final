# jest-worker

Module for executing heavy tasks under forked processes in parallel, by providing a `Promise` based interface, minimum overhead, and bound workers.

The module works by providing an absolute path of the module to be loaded in all forked processes. Files relative to a node module are also accepted. All methods are exposed on the parent process as promises, so they can be `await`'ed. Child (worker) methods can either be synchronous or asynchronous.

The module also implements support for bound workers. Binding a worker means that, based on certain parameters, the same task will always be executed by the same worker. The way bound workers work is by using the returned string of the `computeWorkerKey` method. If the string was used before for a task, the call will be queued to the related worker that processed the task earlier; if not, it will be executed by the first available worker, then sticked to the worker that executed it; so the next time it will be processed by the same worker. If you have no preference on the worker executing the task, but you have defined a `computeWorkerKey` method because you want _some_ of the tasks to be sticked, you can return `null` from it.

The list of exposed methods can be explicitly provided via the `exposedMethods` option. If it is not provided, it will be obtained by requiring the child module into the main process, and analyzed via reflection. Check the "minimal example" section for a valid one.

## Install

```sh
$ yarn add jest-worker
```

## Example

This example covers the minimal usage:

### File `parent.js`

```javascript
import {Worker as JestWorker} from 'jest-worker';

async function main() {
  const worker = new JestWorker(require.resolve('./Worker'));
  const result = await worker.hello('Alice'); // "Hello, Alice"
}

main();
```

### File `worker.js`

```javascript
export function hello(param) {
  return 'Hello, ' + param;
}
```
