# webpack-merge - Merge designed for Webpack

**webpack-merge** provides a `merge` function that concatenates arrays and merges objects creating a new object. If functions are encountered, it will execute them, run the results through the algorithm, and then wrap the returned values within a function again.

This behavior is particularly useful in configuring webpack although it has uses beyond it. Whenever you need to merge configuration objects, **webpack-merge** can come in handy.

## **`merge(...configuration | [...configuration])`**

`merge` is the core, and the most important idea, of the API. Often this is all you need unless you want further customization.

```javascript
const { merge } = require('webpack-merge');

// Default API
const output = merge(object1, object2, object3, ...);
